    * needs some thought: if the padding is PKCS7, it is never zero
        bytes in length
    * Keccak not currently supported
    * chunk hash could follow the header
    * the spec limits chunks to 1 MB

    * WrongOAEPSize needs a better name -- it would be the decrypted
        data which has the wrong size

    * SHA1_LEN becomes xu.SHA1_BIN_LEN, etc
    * prefer SHA256 to SHA3
    * can we use SHA256 for dig sigs?
    * revise documenation accordingly

    * review code to see whether it can handle large files, those
        where total length of chunk keys exceeds MAX_CHUNK_BYTES
